My name is Rajiv Koliwad, a rising 4th year student at the University of Virginia studying Computer Science. This summer, I will be working @ [NASA Jet Propulsion Lab](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/) ðŸš€


My interest in Computer Science emminates from the immense promise and impact of well written code - aside from the fact that making things is extremley fun. 

For the past two summers, I have had the privledge to work in [The Butte Lab](https://buttelab.ucsf.edu/) working on an LLM-powered clinical matching pipeline. 

My current course work, academic, and professional interest lie within applications of AI, ML, as well as more traditional software engineering.

Outside of class, I enjoy running - most recently completed the San Francisco Half Marathon. I also enjoy playing soccer and playing guitar.
