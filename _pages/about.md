My name is Rajiv Koliwad, and I’m a rising 4th-year student at the University of Virginia studying Computer Science. This summer, I’ll be working at [NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/).

My passion for Computer Science comes from the immense promise and impact that well-written code can have — plus, it’s incredibly fun to create things!

Over the past two summers, I’ve had the privilege of working in [The Butte Lab](https://buttelab.ucsf.edu/), where I helped develop an LLM-powered clinical matching pipeline.

Currently, my academic focus and professional interests revolve around applications of AI, ML, and traditional software engineering.

Outside of class, I enjoy running — I recently completed the San Francisco Half Marathon. I also love playing soccer and guitar.
